future features:
* maybe add arbitrary tags to player as well
* ammo for guns?
* fix skills, DRY
* extract inventory system with scrolling selection list
* DR penetration / damage types
* karma system to track all the messed up stuff the player does

observations:
* writing is taking most of the time
* mixing coding and writing and game design is bad
  * want to make plot/design decisions to simplify code, lol
* good to build content where you can re-use features instead of having to crack out code+content
