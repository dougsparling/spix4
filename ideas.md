future features:
* maybe add arbitrary tags to player as well
* ammo for guns?
* fix skills, DRY
* extract inventory system with scrolling selection list
* DR penetration / damage types

observations:
* writing is taking most of the time
* mixing coding and writing and game design is bad
  * want to make plot/design decisions to simplify code, lol
